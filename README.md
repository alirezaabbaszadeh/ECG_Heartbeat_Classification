# ECG Heartbeat Classification

## Clinical Relevance
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting arrhythmias and other cardiac abnormalities. Accurate heartbeat classification helps clinicians identify life‑threatening conditions early, supports continuous patient monitoring, and guides timely intervention.

## Repository Overview
This repository investigates ECG heartbeat classification with a modern Conformer‑based architecture. It includes scripts for dataset preparation, focused hyperparameter tuning, and a comprehensive evaluation pipeline:

- **Hyperparameter tuning** – `run_hyperparameter_tuning.py` explores model configurations to optimize performance.
- **Conformer architecture** – `ModelBuilder.py` defines the CNN‑Conformer model and related ablation variants.
- **Evaluation workflow** – `run_kfold_evaluation.py` and `run_final_evaluation.py` provide reproducible k‑fold and held‑out evaluations.

## Reproducible Research
Consistent configuration files, deterministic seeds, and scripted training/evaluation workflows align the project with reproducible research practices, enabling others to replicate and extend the results.
